K28 -- Getting more comfortable with the dev console and the DOM
2023-04-17m

DISCO
-----------------------------------------------------------------
- ctrl + shift + j for console in vivaldi.
- <script src="dommy_consolery.js"></script> links the js file to the html file
- implemented functions don't change how it looks on html but prints in the console
- priority matters in the <style> tags
  - the colors at the bottom take most priority
  - a tag might say class="red green blue", but it will be red if red is the last color in the <style> tags
- putting function call within brakets in ()=>{} does not make the function call immediately when html is run

QCC
-----------------------------------------------------------------
- Why would you want to initialize a function like var f = function(){}?
- You can list a function as a key/value pair in a dictionary?
  - How would you run that?
- var o looks like a dictionary but it's considered an object? Are objects more general? What is an object?
- Not sure what syntax for this does
  const myFxn = (param1, param2) => {
    // body
    return retVal;
  };

K19 -- Sessions Greetings
2022-11-03
time spent: 3.5 hours

DISCO:
* Imports needed for sessions:
    from flask import redirect
    from flask import session
    import os
* Generates a random secret key:
    app.secret_key = os.urandom(32)
* Checks if the user is in a session:
    if 'username' in session:
* Removes the user from a session:
        session.pop('username')
* Redirects the user to "/page":
    return redirect("/page")
* Creates a session/cookie with the user-inputter username and password:
    session['username'] = request.form['username'], request.form['password']
* We can insert a link into buttons:
    <a href="/logout" name="logout" value="Logout"><button>Logout</button></a>

QCC:
* We are having difficulties making the user variable Elmo. Thus, there is no username on the response page.
* What does the secret_key do? Why does the webpage not work if we comment out the secret_key?

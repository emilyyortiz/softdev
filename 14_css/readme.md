### DISCO
* To set the the nav bar to the correct width, we had to encase it in a <\div> tag and added a width property:
```
#navigate {
    width: 100%;
}
```
* To remove extra spaces around elements, we had to set the margins and padding to 0%:
```
margin: 0%;
padding: 0%;
```
* In index.html, we had to edit the link so it could properly access our style sheet: ```href="../static/style.css"```

### QCC
* We need to keep line 9 in app.py: ```app = Flask(__name__)```, but we're not completely sure what this does.

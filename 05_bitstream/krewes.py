K05 -- Populating Krewes Dictionary
2022-09-29
time spent: 2 hours

DISCO: We learned how to open files, read them into a string, create dictionaries,
       add keys and values to dictionaries.

QCC: Is there a more efficient list type to store three separate corresponding values?
     What is a tuple and how do we use it?
     Should the period keys be integers?
